# This file is in YAML format.  You must ensure that the punctuation
# and whitespace is preserved.  Also, beware of ':' and quotation mark
# characters: these have meaning in YAML and so must be "escaped" by
# enclosing the entire field in (single) quotation marks, or using the multi-line string formatting characters ('|' for preserving newlines, '>' for folding newlines).
# See the YAML specification  (https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) or the wikipedia page about YAML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
# Also, Educative has a nice YAML tutorial (https://www.educative.io/blog/yaml-tutorial) that gives a nice rationale for learning YAML.

topic: >
  A web-based "This or That" game where users vote for their favorite dog image between two options. 
  The system records votes, fetches new images after each selection, and maintains a leaderboard of the most popular images. 
  Built with Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, it provides an engaging and seamless experience.

competitor_rivalry: >
  Moderate. There are many voting-based games and interactive apps, but adding fun features 
  and a clean design can help stand out. Unique elements such as real-time leaderboards, 
  customizable themes, and social media integration can increase engagement and retention.

new_entrant_threat: >
  High. Developing a similar game is relatively easy with existing technologies and 
  open-source libraries. However, strong branding, community engagement, and unique features 
  like AI-generated images or rewards for frequent users can serve as entry barriers.

substitute_threat: >
  High. Many entertainment apps, social media polls, and meme-sharing platforms offer 
  alternative ways for users to engage in similar voting-based experiences. A key differentiator 
  would be incorporating gamification elements, rewards, and exclusive content.

customer_power: >
  High. Users have numerous choices for entertainment and can easily switch to other platforms 
  if they find the experience unengaging. To retain users, continuous updates, interactive 
  features, and user-friendly design must be prioritized.

supplier_power: >
  Low to moderate. The primary dependencies are cloud storage providers, AI-based image 
  processing (if used), and APIs for fetching dog images. The availability of multiple providers 
  ensures flexibility, but pricing or service disruptions from key suppliers could pose a risk.

competitive_strategy: >
  Differentiation and user engagement are key. Enhancing the user experience through seamless UI, 
  gamification, and social media integration will help the game stand out. Developing a loyal 
  community through engagement strategies, exclusive content, and periodic updates can mitigate 
  threats from competitors and substitutes. 

  Additionally, partnerships with pet-related brands or influencers could expand visibility and 
  attract a dedicated user base.
