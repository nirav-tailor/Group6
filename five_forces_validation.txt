*** customer_power ***

High. Users have numerous choices for entertainment and can easily switch to other platforms  if they find the experience unengaging. To retain users, continuous updates, interactive  features, and user-friendly design must be prioritized.

*** substitute_threat ***

High. Many entertainment apps, social media polls, and meme-sharing platforms offer  alternative ways for users to engage in similar voting-based experiences. A key differentiator  would be incorporating gamification elements, rewards, and exclusive content.

*** new_entrant_threat ***

High. Developing a similar game is relatively easy with existing technologies and  open-source libraries. However, strong branding, community engagement, and unique features  like AI-generated images or rewards for frequent users can serve as entry barriers.

*** competitor_rivalry ***

Moderate. There are many voting-based games and interactive apps, but adding fun features  and a clean design can help stand out. Unique elements such as real-time leaderboards,  customizable themes, and social media integration can increase engagement and retention.

*** supplier_power ***

Low to moderate. The primary dependencies are cloud storage providers, AI-based image  processing (if used), and APIs for fetching dog images. The availability of multiple providers  ensures flexibility, but pricing or service disruptions from key suppliers could pose a risk.

*** competitive_strategy ***

Differentiation and user engagement are key. Enhancing the user experience through seamless UI,  gamification, and social media integration will help the game stand out. Developing a loyal  community through engagement strategies, exclusive content, and periodic updates can mitigate  threats from competitors and substitutes.
Additionally, partnerships with pet-related brands or influencers could expand visibility and  attract a dedicated user base.
